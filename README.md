# Introduction 
This repository contains the demo code for the .NET Sk√•ne meetup presentation on .NET Aspire.

It's based on the Aspire-starter template. To create your own version just run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new aspire-starter -n MyAspireApp
```

This will create a new solution with an API and a Blazor Web application.

# Running the Demo
To run the demo, you need to have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from [the official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
We also recommend using Aspire CLI for managing your Aspire projects. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Aspire.Cli
```
After installing the CLI, you can run the demo by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
aspire run
```
